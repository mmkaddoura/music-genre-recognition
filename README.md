# music-genre-recognition

## Introduction 

MIR (Music Information Retrieval) deals with the analysis of musical content by combining aspects from signal processing, machine learning, and music theory.

MGR (Music Genre Recognition) is a subfield of MIR. Automatic MGR is significant as it enables systems to perform content based music recommendations as well as help organize musical databases.

## Deep Learning Goal

Our overall Deep Learning task is to try come up with a model that performs better on the GTZAN dataset than the majority of other entries.

We are interested in implementing the framework proposed in the blog ["Music Genre Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks‚Äù](https://towardsdatascience.com/music-genre-recognition-using-convolutional-neural-networks-cnn-part-1-212c6b93da76) by Kunal Vaidya and see if we can recreate the same high accuracy.

## Data

We are using the [GTZAN dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification).

## Techniques

For our analysis we are interested in translating the Convolutional Neural Network model from the blog from tensorflow to pytorch and see if we can replicate or even improve upon the accuracy.
